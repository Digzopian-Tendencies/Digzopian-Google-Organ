# Digzopian Google Organ

This repo binds all Google integrations (Cloud, Drive, Workspace, Gemini) as an **Organ** of the Digzopian-Protocol-Standard.

## Purpose
- Store Gemini stub templates (`/stubs/`) for missing Google secrets.
- Log fulfilled tasks (`/logs/`).
- Workflows detect missing GOOGLE_* secrets and auto-generate stubs.
- Ensures Gemini tasks are doctrine-bound and traceable.
